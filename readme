SMS Naive Bayes Classifier - v1
-------------------------

DESCRIPTION
--------------

SMS Naive Bayes Classifier is a classifier that uses multivariant random variables to classify SMS as "ham" or "spam".

2. USAGE
--------

It is possible to set the verbose level in SMS_bayes.py. When the k_fold_text function is called, the last parameter is verbose level (True or False).

k_fold_text() requires:
  -the number of folds
  -a dataset as a dictionary with SMS text as key and classification as value
  -a list of strings of target values (values of possible classification)
  -the verbose level (True for verbose output, False otherwise)

textClassifyNaiveBayes is a class that manages the classification of a word given a training set.
In __init__() the class computes the probability of each target value and of each word given each target value separately.
These probabilities are stored in some instance variables, that are used from the classify() function for the classification of each new instance.
The classify() function returns a value between 0 and 1 for each target value. The target value that has maximum value is the one selected from the classifier for the new istance.

__init__() function requires:
  -a dataset as a dictionary with SMS text as key and classification as value
  -a list of string of target values (values of possibile classification)
  -a vocabulary of all words in all SMSs; the key of this vocabulary is the word and the value is the number of times that word appears in the dataset

classify() function requires:
  -a new instance as SMS text
